1
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,320
You know there's always something
about that tangle of strangers

2
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,770
pressed together for days with
nothing in common but the need

3
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,670
to go from one place to another
and never see each other again.

4
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,500
I see evil on this train.

5
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,020
A passenger has died.

6
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,050
So they got him after all.

7
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,680
You assume he was killed? 

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,640
No, no, no, no.

9
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,880
He was in perfectly good health,

10
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,200
he had his enemies.

11
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,870
Indeed, he was murdered.

12
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,340
Good God!

13
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,690
A murder?

14
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,650
Here?

15
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,610
(inaudible) Someone was rummaging
around my cabin in the middle of

16
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,680
the night, no one would listen to me. 

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,570
If there was a murder, 
What is going on? 

18
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,620
…

19
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,580
then there was a murderer.

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,220
The murderer is with us,
and every one of you is a suspect.

21
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,470
And who are you? 

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,000
My name is Hercule Poirot and I'm
probably the greatest detective

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,410
in the world.
