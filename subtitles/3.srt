1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,840
It's no surprise President Obama's
oldest daughter Malia will attend

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,620
Harvard University, the school
from which both her parents received

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,580
law degrees.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,020
But what is raising some eyebrows
is the year off Malia will take,

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,230
a gap year as it's called,
before she begins Harvard in the

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,640
fall of 2017.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,960
Can taking a year off before college
be beneficial to a student?

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,650
Elizabeth Armstrong is professor
of sociology and organizational

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,320
studies at the University of Michigan
and she joins us now.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,060
Hi Elizabeth, thanks for being with us.

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,800
Hi, thanks for having me.

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,400
So, Elizabeth, do you see this
as being a positive for almost

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,360
any student?

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:43,770
I think so, I think that the additional
space to have some chance to grow

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,800
up and get some autonomy,
I think it's a good thing.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,960
So clearly Malia Obama is in a
unique position but for other students

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,170
whose parents perhaps do not run
the country, does taking a year

18
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,130
off carry with it a stigma that
could be interpreted as being lazy?

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,520
I don't think so, I think the main
challenge is that obviously most

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,280
families don't have the resources
of the Obamas and the issue of

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,890
funding the gap year in a way that
makes it kind of developmentally

22
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,350
useful in some sense can be a
challenge.

23
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,580
But actually because for a lot
of young people simply getting

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,690
into the workforce a little bit
can be a good thing.

25
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,010
I have a question about that,
if you are going into the workforce

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,660
with that gap year, should you
do something that is career oriented

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,050
or do you just want to make some
money and save up for school?

28
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,610
Well, I think either because I
think in some ways one of the reasons

29
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,380
why a gap year can be very beneficial
is it's about sort of psychological

30
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,400
and emotional development,
to have the maturity to handle

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,060
the complexity of the college
environment, getting some space

32
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,860
from parents, getting some space
from everybody's expectations,

33
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,600
the expectations of your peers,
of teachers, of parents,

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,080
and really trying to figure out
who you are as a person and what

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,280
you want, and even just getting
some expertise with things like

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,360
a laundry maybe, you know,
balancing a checkbook,

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,320
things like that.

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,050
I can see how taking that breather
after the stress of senior year

39
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,520
can help sort of clear your mind
and let you enter college with

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,030
a renewed sort of purpose and energy,
but what are some of the specific

41
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,880
things that you recommend students
do with a gap year?

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,120
Community service, internships.

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,590
What are some of great ideas?

44
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,220
I was just talking with my son
who's taking a gap year this year,

45
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,630
he's taking a gap year after his
first year of college and his advice

46
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:51,540
was travel but don't do it with
any kind of program or travel agent,

47
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,980
just go.

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,250
Arrange it yourself,
buy the tickets yourself,

49
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,210
just really go out into the world
and do it on your own.

50
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,750
And then for that, I mean,
he's funded his year,

51
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,520
so I think that's part of it too.

52
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,710
It's because the necessity is
developing more autonomy.

53
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,730
I think that if the kids can kind
of have some kind of skin in the

54
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,840
game in the sense of working to
make the money for the traveling…

55
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,790
In your son's case, did he save
up before senior year?

56
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,220
Did he work to save up money for
the gap year?

57
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,740
Well, actually he took the first
year and then he spent the first

58
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,750
semester working landscaping just
around town to save up money.

59
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,350
Well, of course, that wouldn't
have worked if he wasn't sort of

60
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,890
still like living at home and kind
of being supported in a lot of

61
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,290
ways with me which comes back to
the privilege issue.

62
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:52,290
I mean, for this to really be something
that can be beneficial,

63
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,640
there is a certain amount of financial
aspects to it.

64
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,230
It may exacerbate inequalities
in some ways rather than level them.

65
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,950
So do we know how common the gap
year is among United States'

66
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,910
students?

67
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,350
I don't know if there's been any
systematic research on that yet.

68
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,120
I mean anecdotally, I think it's
becoming more common.

69
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,000
I know at least one of my son's
friends did it as well.

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,710
When I talk to people of my generation,
a number of them are like "oh yeah

71
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,430
I kind of did that but we didn't
really talk about it then."    We

72
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,740
didn't have a name for it,
now it's called the gap year.

73
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,530
There was just taking some time off.

74
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,630
I can totally see the benefits of it.

75
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,060
Thank you so much Elizabeth Armstrong
for all that.
