1
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,840
You're looking particularly beautiful tonight

2
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,880
You're looking particularly beautiful tonight

3
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,020
Ching

4
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,440
We have a problem

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,820
Good

6
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,420
The identities of our serving agents have been exposed

7
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,040
The country is in a state of complete chaos

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,860
and the universe sends me you...

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:53,940
Sir!

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,980
Yes alright Boff we're going on a mission not a honeymoon

11
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,940
Yes of course Sir...

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,640
Destination?

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,980
South of France, Sir

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,540
Arm the missiles...

15
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,280
They're just cyclists Sir...

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,560
They're French cyclists Boff

17
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,900
and they're obstructing Her Majesties Secret Service

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,200
She's the key to this case

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,520
I'm not sure I've ever met a man quite like you

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,300
Well let me clear up the uncertainty for you...

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
You haven't

22
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,620
Virtual reality?

23
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,620
It's completely immersive and some people loose track of their actual surroundings...

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,260
I think we can pretty much guarantee that that's not going to happen

25
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:47,565
Tell me the agent you've got in the field is making some progress...

26
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,540
Target acquired, this is a job for the shoebox inflate...

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,560
NO DON'T PULL IT IN THE CAR!

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,140
Can you reach your door handle?

29
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,620
Not, not really Sir...

30
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,880
Magnetic boots

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,700
Brilliant Sir

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,500
No one must have the slightest clue we're here...

33
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,400
*Alarm*

34
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Till we meet again

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:00:00,000
That was sooner than I expected
