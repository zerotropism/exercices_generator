00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,270
In the new movie The Internship, Vince
Vaughn and Owen Wilson play middle-aged

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,710
out of work salesman that somehow
land Google internships.

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,200
That's a sharpie by the way, genius.

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,630
That's my fault.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,410
The movie focuses on a fierce
competition among the interns to

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,920
get full-time jobs at Google,
but in real life, the challenge

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,530
is just landing a Google internship.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,660
It was immediately captivating. 

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,470
New York native and Yale student,
Florian Collins Berger is an intern

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,790
for the marketing department. 

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,020
This seemed like the smartest place
to pick up a lot of different skills

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,980
in one summer.

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,480
I've never been put in an environment
where work and play are so sort

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,390
of seamlessly integrated and still
felt productive.

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,320
He is one of the 1,500 interns
selected this summer out of a record

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,590
high pool of more than 40,000
applicants.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,250
At that rate, it's harder to get
into the Google internship program

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,230
than into Harvard or Stanford.

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,930
Kyle Ewing heads the internship
program. 

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,170
There's no best way to get into Google,
at the end of the day we're looking

21
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:08,090
for students who are smart,
who are creative, who are leaders,

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,800
who are passionate inside and outside
of work, who care about their community

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,510
and who really care about technology.

24
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,290
Applicants must be full-time students,
if they make it past the written

25
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,440
application phase, they go through
a series of phone and face-to-face

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,330
interviews with questions reportedly
ranging from coding to quirky.

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,720
In addition to the famous Google
perks like free food,

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,150
campus bikes and gym access,
interns also get paid a competitive

29
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,110
wage.

30
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,980
The average Google intern makes
about 5,800 dollars per month.

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,580
If you're a software engineer intern
at Google, you're making about

32
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,540
6,500 dollars per month,
even more and that's upwards of

33
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,430
75,000 dollars per year.

34
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,780
75,000 dollars per year is much
higher than the average U.S.

35
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,740
worker. 

36
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,610
Interns are expected to complete
a project and get hands on experience.

37
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,610
Even in my first few weeks, I'd
put out code that everyone was

38
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,760
using and it was really cool to
call my mom and get to say like "Mom,

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,420
Mom look what I'm doing!"     Software
engineer Kitt Vanderwater, interned for

40
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,140
Google for two summers,
and is now a full-time employee.

41
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,930
As soon as I started my senior
year I knew I'd have a job at Google

42
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,740
and that was really great peace
of mind. 

43
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,120
Something most interns are hoping
to get when they return for their

44
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,080
senior year.

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,020
In San Francisco, I'm Kara Tsuboi,
CNET.com for CBS News.
